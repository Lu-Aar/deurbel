#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.

src/bin/local_defs.rs
# This file contains local definitions for the binary, such as WiFi credentials and Discord webhook URL
# It is not meant to be included in the repository for security reasons.
# It should be created by the user in their local environment.
# The file is intentionally left empty in the repository.
# Users should create their own `local_defs.rs` file in the `src/bin/`
# directory with their own local definitions.
# Example content:
# ```rust
# pub const WIFI_SSID: &str = "YourSSID";
# pub const WIFI_PASSWORD: &str = "YourPassword";
# pub const DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: &str = "YourWebhookURL";
# pub const DISCORD_TTS: bool = false; // Set to true if you want Text To Speach messages
# ```
